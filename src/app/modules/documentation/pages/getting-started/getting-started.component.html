  <h1 class="display-6">Angular Overview</h1>
  <p>This guide provides a quick snapshot of the core features of Angular.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Angular is a platform and framework developed by Google for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular integrates application components with declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.</p>

  <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
  <p>Angular's architecture is built on several key concepts, described below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modules:</strong> Angular organizes code into buckets called modules, which manage the pieces of your application.</li>
    <li><strong>Components:</strong> Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that connects a component hierarchy with the page document object model (DOM).</li>
    <li><strong>Templates:</strong> Templates define views in an Angular application. They are composed of HTML enhanced with Angular directives.</li>
    <li><strong>Services:</strong> Services are wide-ranging classes for features that are not directly related to views. Dependency injection (DI) lets you provide these classes to components as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Routing:</strong> The Angular Router enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core Features</h2>
  <p>Here are some of the core features of Angular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Binding:</strong> Angular provides data binding capabilities between the component class and its template. You can use interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding.</li>
    <li><strong>Directives:</strong> Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM. Examples include <code>ngModel</code>, <code>ngClass</code>, and <code>ngIf</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Services and Dependency Injection:</strong> Angular's DI system provides services or other functions to components, improving code modularity and reusability.</li>
    <li><strong>Pipes:</strong> Pipes transform displayed values within a template. You can use pipes like <code>date</code> and <code>currency</code> for formatting.</li>
    <li><strong>Forms:</strong> Angular offers two types of forms: reactive and template-driven, each with its own set of capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Http Client:</strong> Angular provides a powerful HTTP client for interact with RESTful APIs.</li>
    <li><strong>Routing and Navigation:</strong> Manage the state of the application and navigate between different functional aspects of your application.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Development Practices</h2>
  <p>Angular's tooling and ecosystem support best practices in software development:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Angular makes it easy to write unit and end-to-end tests. It is supported out-of-the-box with tools such as Karma and Jasmine.</li>
    <li><strong>Build and Deployment:</strong> Angular CLI supports development, building, and deploying applications easily.</li>
    <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Complex choreographies and animations can be defined clearly and more succinctly with Angular's animation support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Angular provides a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. It emphasizes code organization, testability, and powerful tooling.</p>
